 Version 2009080300 
 Bug fix by Guy Thomas
    On downloading an entire folder as a zip file, some reverse-proxy servers would handle the request incorrectly and a zip file would be downloaded with a file size of 0KB. This has been fixed by forcing the mime type to application/x-forcedownload for a folder being downloaded as a zip and by enabling the max folder size to be set or simply by removing the size header (if cfgMaxFolderZipSizeMB=0)
    Added config var max folder zip size for downloading folders as zips - $smb_cfg->cfgMaxFolderZipSizeMB
 
 Version 2009060900
